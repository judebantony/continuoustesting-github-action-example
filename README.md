## Continuous Testing in DevSecOps
Continuous testing in DevSecOps is a type of software testing that involves testing at every stage of the development life cycle. The goal of continuous testing is to evaluate the quality of the software as part of a continuous delivery process, by testing early and often. 

The old way of testing was hand off centric. The software was handed off from one team to another. A project would have definite Development and QA phases. QA teams always wanted more time to ensure quality. The goal was that the quality should prevail over project schedule.

Businesses of today, however, business wants faster delivery of software to the end user. The newer is the software, the better it can be marketed and increase revenue potential of the company. Hence, a new way of testing was evolved. Continuous Testing is a procedure of testing early, testing regular, test everywhere, and automate. Continuous means undisrupted testing done on a continuous basis. In a Continuous DevSecOps process, a software change continuously moves from Development to Testing to Deployment. The This process helps us to find the risk, address them and improve the quality of the product.
